A plot of the counts of students using different modes of travel to
school over time (2018/2019 to 2022/2023 shown as years for which we
have a high response rate), with facets showing different travel plan
(TP) ratings, is shown below.

The modeshift dataset contains a detailed breakdown by mode, with the
number of observations for each mode and year shown below:

To get a handle on the rate of change, we’ll focus on a subset of
schools that have continuous records for the 5 years from 2018/2019 to
2022/2023. Of the 4958 schools in the dataset, 269 schools have
continuous records for the 5 years from 2018/2019 to 2022/2023.

Let’s calculate the rate of change in proportions:

Let’s visualise the change in % active travel by group, with breaks at
-0.5, 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.08, 1:
